We just spent the week announcing something new every day. This blog post gives an overview of what's new at Documenso.

## A week of announcements

### Day 1: Documenso Design System

We open-sourced Documenso's design system.

Documenso isn't just an open-source alternative to DocuSign. It's a beautiful document signing experience.

We welcome every developer AND designer to contribute to building the product.

[This Figma file]() serves as an open source guide for the design of the product across website, desktop & mobile apps, and brand.

It includes design tokens, primitives and components, screens, and brand assets.

Go duplicate and remix it!

### Day 2: Malfunction Mania

Documenso 1.0 just hit the testing environment.

We want to ensure the best possible release. That's why we started this week a public testing phase, the most significant community project yet, where we invite you to try out the new version, report and fix bugs and give feedback before release. 

We call it "Malfunction Mania."

Early contributors love it so far:

"I love the refresh. The UI is much cleaner and the possibility to select the signature spot, date, name, email, and change the size, is a life-saver..."

Documenso's co-founder and CEO Timur shared the details in [this announcement]().

### Day 3: Documenso Shop

Supporting and contributing to open-source projects like Documenso is cool for sure.

Do you know what's *even* cooler tho? To wear swag from open-source projects.

We announced the [Documenso Shop](https://documen.so/shop), a place where you can buy some merch. Suit up!

### Day 4: Early Adopter Plan

As we ramp up development speed, we introduced the [Early Adopter Plan](https://documen.so/pricing), a special, fixed $30/mo offer for 100 early adopters who want to get deep hands-on feedback.

Timur published a blog post [here]() to explain how we plan to build the core version of [documenso.com](http://documenso.com/).

### Day 5: Upcoming Launches
